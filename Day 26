Day 26 ▸ 5 decisions AI should never make alone
The fifth one defines responsible agility…
Teams either overtrust AI or underuse it.

Here’s how to balance judgment:
↬ Let AI inform decisions
↬ Keep humans accountable
↬ Decide together, consciously

Balanced teams make 45% better decisions.
AI informs; humans decide.

Here’s the healthy balance:
1️. AI control → AI guidance
2️. Human guesswork → AI insight
3️. Blind trust → Conscious trust
4️. Automation bias → Human judgment
5️. Tool usage → Partnership

🎯 Responsibility stays human − intelligence is shared.
❓👇 Where should humans decide more consciously?
