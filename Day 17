The third risk damages trust silently…
Speed-focused delivery ignores ethical consequences.

Here’s how to embed ethics:
↬ Define ethical boundaries
↬ Use AI to monitor risks
↬ Pause when signals warn

Ethically guided teams sustain trust 3× longer.
Agility without ethics erodes credibility.

Here’s how AI Agile protects trust:
1️. Speed-first → Responsibility-first
2️. Blind automation → Ethical guardrails
3️. Short-term wins → Long-term trust
4️. Ignored bias → Bias detection
5️. Output focus → Ethical outcomes

🎯 Trust compounds slower than speed, but lasts longer.
