Day 32 ▸ 4 ways guardrails outperform approvals
The first one unlocks speed immediately…
Approval-heavy governance creates delay and workarounds.

Here’s how to use guardrails effectively:
↬ Define clear boundaries
↬ Monitor compliance with AI
↬ Allow fast decisions inside limits

Guardrail-based teams respond 30% faster.
Guardrails guide behavior without blocking flow.

Here’s what improves:
1️. Approval gates → Decision freedom
2️. Waiting time → Immediate action
3️. Hidden risk → Visible signals
4️. Rule breaking → Responsible choice
5️. Slow delivery → Safe speed

🎯 Freedom works best with clear boundaries.
