Day 23 ▸ 4 limits of coordination-heavy teams
The fourth one quietly drains momentum…
Teams spend more time coordinating work than creating value.

Here’s how to shift to co-creation:
↬ Work together in real time
↬ Let AI maintain shared context
↬ Reduce dependency delays

Co-creating teams reduce cycle time by 30%.
Coordination manages dependencies; co-creation removes them.

Here’s the difference:
1️. Scheduled syncs → Continuous collaboration
2️. Dependency tracking → Shared context
3️. Waiting time → Parallel progress
4️. Status updates → Live visibility
5️. Managed flow → Natural flow

🎯 The best teams create together, not apart.
❓👇 Where does coordination slow you today?
