Day 33 ▸ 5 ethical risks speed often hides
The fifth risk damages trust silently…
Ethics are reviewed after incidents, not monitored during work.

Here’s how to embed ethics daily:
↬ Define ethical signals
↬ Use AI to detect drift
↬ Act before harm occurs

Continuous ethics monitoring reduces risk exposure by 50%.
Ethics must live inside execution.

Here’s how AI Agile enables that:
1️. After-the-fact reviews → Live monitoring
2️. Assumed fairness → Bias detection
3️. Silent drift → Early warnings
4️. Human-only checks → AI + human oversight
5️. Reactive fixes → Preventive action

🎯 Ethics delayed is ethics denied.
❓👇 Which ethical signal should you monitor live?
