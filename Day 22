Day 22 ▸ 5 reasons silos still break agility
The third one hides in plain sight…
Workflows across roles, but ownership stays trapped inside silos.

Here’s how to remove silos:
↬ Enable cross-role collaboration
↬ Let AI connect work end-to-end
↬ Share ownership of outcomes

Cross-functional teams deliver 35% faster outcomes.
Silos slow learning, decisions, and delivery.

Here’s how AI Agile breaks them:
1️. Role boundaries → Shared responsibility
2️. Handoffs → Co-creation
3️. Fragmented context → Unified insight
4️. Local ownership → Outcome ownership
5️. Manual coordination → AI-assisted flow

🎯 Value flows faster when ownership is shared.
❓👇 Which 1 silo hurts your delivery most?
