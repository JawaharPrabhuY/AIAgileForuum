Day 15 ▸ 5 reasons output-driven agility now fails
The fourth one misleads leadership decisions…
Teams deliver more work, yet real impact remains unclear.

Here’s how to refocus on outcomes:
↬ Define success by impact
↬ Use AI to measure value
↬ Review outcomes continuously

Outcome-focused teams outperform output-driven teams by 2×.
Output measures activity, not progress.

Here’s how AI Agile reframes success:
1️. Tasks completed → Outcomes achieved
2️. Velocity increase → Value realization
3️. Busy teams → Impactful teams
4️. Delivery count → Outcome quality
5️. Short-term wins → Sustainable value

🎯 Doing more isn’t progress without impact.
❓👇 Which 1 outcome truly defines success for you?
