Day 4 ▸ 3 limits of purpose without AI
Most leaders underestimate the second one…
Purpose alone can’t navigate complex, fast-changing systems.

Here’s how to balance both:
↬ Set intent with humans
↬ Navigate complexity with AI
↬ Adjust direction continuously

AI-guided teams adapt 2× faster to change.
Purpose sets direction; intelligence finds the path.

Here’s how balance works:
1️. Vision → Navigation
2️. Intent → Prediction
3️. Belief → Evidence
4️. Static goals → Adaptive goals
5️. Hope → Informed action

🎯 Purpose needs intelligence to stay relevant.
❓👇 Where do you rely on purpose alone today?
