Day 19 ▸ 5 dangers of high-volume delivery
The fifth one drains teams quietly…
Pushing volume increases fatigue without increasing value.

Here’s how to reduce noise:
↬ Limit work intelligently
↬ Prioritize high-impact items
↬ Use AI to filter value

Low-volume, high-impact teams deliver 30% more value.
More work often means less clarity.

Here’s the AI Agile alternative:
1️. More tasks → Better choices
2️. Volume pressure → Impact focus
3️. Exhaustion → Sustainable pace
4️. Feature flood → Value clarity
5️. Noise → Signal

🎯 Less volume creates more meaning.
