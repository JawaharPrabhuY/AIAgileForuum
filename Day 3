Day 3 ▸ 5 mistakes teams make using AI
The third mistake limits real value…
Teams treat AI as automation, not as intelligence.

Here’s how to partner with AI:
↬ Use AI for sense-making
↬ Let AI challenge assumptions
↬ Combine AI insight with human judgment

Teams using AI as a partner improve decisions by 40%.
AI creates value when it thinks with us.

Here’s the mindset shift:
1️. AI as tool → AI as teammate
2️. Automation only → Intelligence amplification
3️. Human bias → AI pattern detection
4️. Reactive decisions → Predictive decisions
5️. Guesswork → Informed clarity

🎯 AI adds value when humans stay intentional.
