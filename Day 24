Day 24 ▸ 5 ways AI strengthens team capability
The second one surprises most teams…
Teams are limited by available skills and capacity.

Here’s how AI expands capability:
↬ Use AI as a skill amplifier
↬ Let AI support decisions
↬ Reduce dependency on specialists

AI-augmented teams solve problems 2× faster.
AI doesn’t replace roles − it strengthens teams.

Here’s what changes:
1️. Skill gaps → Skill amplification
2️. Specialist bottlenecks → Shared capability
3️. Human-only insight → Human + AI insight
4️. Limited capacity → Expanded capacity
5️. Dependency risk → Team resilience

🎯 Capability grows when intelligence is shared.
