Day 31 ▸ 3 reasons trust beats control
The third reason defines future leadership…
Control-based systems assume people need supervision.

Here’s how to build trust safely:
↬ Set clear ethical intent
↬ Use AI to verify signals
↬ Hold humans accountable

Trust-based teams sustain performance 2× longer.
Trust doesn’t remove governance − it transforms it.

Here’s the shift:
1️. Micromanagement → Clear intent
2️. Surveillance → Signal-based trust
3️. Fear → Responsibility
4️. Slow approvals → Confident action
5️. Control culture → Trust culture

🎯 Trust scales faster than control ever will.
