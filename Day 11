Day 11 ▸ 4 limits of post-delivery learning
The second limit costs teams the most…
Learning after delivery comes too late to influence outcomes.

Here’s how to learn while delivering:
↬ Embed learning into workflows
↬ Let AI flag deviations early
↬ Adjust before value is lost

Teams learning during execution reduce rework by 30%.
Learning must shape outcomes, not explain failures.

Here’s what changes:
1️. Post-mortems → Live checkpoints
2️. Retrospectives → Continuous reflection
3️. Late corrections → Early adjustments
4️. Failure analysis → Failure prevention
5️. Knowledge capture → Knowledge application

🎯 Learning is most powerful before mistakes harden.
