Day 29 ▸ 5 reasons control fails intelligent work
The fourth one blocks progress silently…
Rigid control assumes predictability, but intelligent systems change continuously.

Here’s how to regain flow safely:
↬ Replace rigid rules with guardrails
↬ Use AI for live oversight
↬ Empower teams within boundaries

Teams using adaptive governance reduce delays by 40%.
Control was designed for stable environments.

Here’s how AI Agile reframes governance:
1️. Fixed rules → Adaptive guardrails
2️. Periodic checks → Continuous signals
3️. Approval queues → Trusted autonomy
4️. Manual policing → AI monitoring
5️. Fear-driven control → Responsibility-driven trust

🎯 Control slows intelligence; guidance amplifies it.
