Day 8 ▸ 5 reasons retrospectives arrive too late
The fourth one quietly blocks improvement…
Agile teams treat learning as a sprint-end activity, not a continuous flow.

Here’s how to learn in real time:
↬ Capture signals continuously
↬ Use AI to surface patterns
↬ Act while work is in motion

Teams with live learning loops improve outcomes by 35%.
Learning loses power when it arrives late.

Here’s how AI Agile changes the learning loop:
1️. Sprint retros → Live reflection
2️. Manual insights → AI pattern detection
3️. After-action learning → In-action learning
4️. Periodic review → Continuous awareness
5️. Slow improvement → Rapid adjustment

🎯 Learning only matters when it’s timely.
❓👇 Which 1 learning signal do you wish you had live?
