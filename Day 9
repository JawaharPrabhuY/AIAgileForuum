Day 9 ▸ 4 feedback delays killing team learning
Most teams don’t see them forming…
Feedback is collected after delivery instead of during execution.

Here’s how to shorten feedback loops:
↬ Use AI for instant insights
↬ Monitor work continuously
↬ Respond before issues compound

Teams using AI feedback loops learn 2× faster.
Feedback fuels learning only when it flows freely.

Here’s what must change:
1️. Sprint reviews → Real-time feedback
2️. Manual analysis → AI insights
3️. Delayed action → Immediate action
4️. Static metrics → Live signals
5️. Periodic learning → Continuous learning

🎯 Fast feedback creates fast growth.
❓👇 Where does feedback slowdown in your flow?
