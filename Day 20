Day 20 ▸ 4 leadership blind spots around ethics
The first one appears harmless…
Leaders delegate ethics instead of owning it.

Here’s how leaders lead ethically:
↬ Set ethical intent
↬ Use AI for oversight
↬ Model responsible decisions

Ethical leadership reduces risk exposure by 50%.
Ethics can’t be outsourced.

Here’s what leadership must do:
1️. Delegate ethics → Own ethics
2️. Implicit values → Explicit principles
3️. Blind trust → Verified behavior
4️. Late response → Early intervention
5️. Short-term wins → Long-term credibility

🎯 Leadership defines the ethical ceiling.
❓👇 Where should leadership intervene sooner?
